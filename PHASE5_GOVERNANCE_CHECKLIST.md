# Phase 5 Governance Checklist

Run this when you want to close Phase 5 properly and prove the new super-admin governance surfaces are healthy.

## Automated Checks

Run:

```bash
npm run test:governance
```

These checks cover:

- super-admin-only governance surfaces
- permission helper behavior by role
- deployment safeguard logic
- operational diagnostics runtime helpers

## Manual Super Admin Checks

Sign in as `super_admin` and open:

- `/admin`
- `/admin/audit-log`
- `/admin/permission-review`
- `/admin/operations-diagnostics`
- `/admin/settings`

### Dashboard

1. Open `/admin`.
2. Confirm the leadership dashboard loads without hydration errors.
3. Confirm `Operational Watchlist` still loads.
4. Confirm leadership links to analytics, settings, and other governance pages still work.

1. Open `/admin/audit-log`.
2. Switch `Audit Scope` between:
   - `All Activity`

4. Confirm `TTS Settings` still loads below that.
5. In `Deployment Safeguards`, confirm:
   - the status cards load
   - the runtime checks load
   - the verification commands are visible
   - the deploy-doc links are visible

## Production Readiness Follow-Up

Before calling Phase 5 complete for production:

1. Run:

```bash
npm run verify:prod-env
```

2. After deployment, run:

```bash
npm run verify:deploy -- https://your-domain.com
```

3. Complete `ADMIN_RUNTIME_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Phase 5 Close Rule

Do not call Phase 5 complete until:

- the automated governance tests pass
- typecheck passes
- `/admin/audit-log` works
- `/admin/permission-review` works
- `/admin/operations-diagnostics` works
- `/admin/settings` shows `Deployment Safeguards`
- no new governance/hydration error appears in the browser
